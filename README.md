# openai-camera
  A small and interesting code that combines two library examples to take a picture from esp32-cam and then ask Openai what it is. The first library is ChatGPT_Client and the second one is camera_example in esp32_camera.

  This small code will get a jpg photo from esp32-cam, then encode the photo in base64, and then send it to openai for query. Before compiling, please remember to add the "ChatGPT_Client" library to the arduino ide. Thanks to Eric Nam Written library to access openai. Also remember to define yourssid, wifipass, openaikey. You can define them in private.h or modify them directly in openai-camera.ino. 
  
  Asking for a photo through openai only costs you a little Money <0.01 USD. So donâ€™t worry.
